# Implement infinite canvas with Konva.js (2025-10-14 19:51Z)

_**User (2025-10-14 14:11Z)**_

Review the PRD.md and task.md and @architecture.mermaid  files. PR 1 is now complete. Now proceed with implementing only the first subtask of PR 2 ( Implement infinite canvas with all three shape types and Zustand integration): "Integrate Konva.js canvas library"

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to review the PRD.md, task.md, and architecture.mermaid files, then implement the first subtask of PR 2, which is "Integrate Konva.js canvas library". They've mentioned that PR 1 is complete, so I should understand what that entailed and then focus on the specific Konva.js integration.

Let me start by reading the files they mentioned to understand the context and requirements.</details></think>

I'll help you implement the first subtask of PR 2 by integrating the Konva.js canvas library. Let me first review the project requirements and current state by reading the key files.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I have a good understanding of the project requirements. From the PRD and task.md, I can see that:

1. **PR #1 is complete** - they have a comprehensive dual authentication system with Firebase (Google OAuth + Email/Password), user profiles, and Zustand state management.

2. **PR #2 needs to be implemented** - This is the "Comprehensive Canvas Engine with All Shapes" and the first subtask is "Integrate Konva.js canvas library".

Looking at the current App.tsx, I can see that the authentication system is fully implemented and the user sees a welcome screen after logging in.

Now I need to focus on PR #2's first subtask: "Integrate Konva.js canvas library". From the architecture.mermaid file, I can see that Konva.js is the chosen canvas library for rendering.

Let me create a TODO list for this specific subtask and then implement it step by step.

The first step is to install Konva.js and react-konva libraries, then create a basic canvas component structure.</details></think>

Now I'll create a todo list for implementing the first subtask of PR #2 and then proceed with the Konva.js integration.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good! Konva and react-konva are now installed. Now I need to create the basic Canvas component. Let me first check what directory I'm in and then create the Canvas component structure.</details></think>
