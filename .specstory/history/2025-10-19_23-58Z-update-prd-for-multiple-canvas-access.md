# Update PRD for multiple canvas access (2025-10-19 23:58Z)

_**User (2025-10-19 16:06Z)**_

Read the following files for context: @PRD.md , @task.md , @architecture.mermaid .

Currently there is only one canvas that all users can access. I would like to implement access for a user to create, share, and access multiple different canvases.

Update the PRD file with a new PR that specifies all the requirements to implement this feature.

_**Assistant (claude-4-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to add multi-canvas support to their collaborative canvas application. This is a significant feature that will require updates to both frontend and backend, as well as the database schema to support multiple canvases per user with sharing capabilities.

Let me analyze what I need to add:

1. Canvas/Room management - users should be able to create new canvases/rooms
2. Canvas sharing - users should be able to share canvases with specific users or make them public
3. Canvas listing/dashboard - users need a way to see all their canvases and shared canvases
4. Navigation between canvases
5. Permission system for different access levels (owner, editor, viewer)
6. Canvas metadata (name, description, creation date, last modified, etc.)

This will require significant backend changes:
- New data models for Canvas/Room entities
- Canvas management endpoints
- Permission/sharing system
- Updated authentication to include canvas-level permissions

Frontend changes:
- Canvas dashboard/list component
- Canvas creation flow
- Sharing interface
- Navigation between canvases
- Update routing to handle multiple canvases

I should structure this as a new PR in the task.md file with all the detailed requirements.</details></think>

I'll analyze the current PRD and task list to add a comprehensive multi-canvas feature. This is a significant enhancement that will require updates to the data model, user interface, and sharing capabilities.

+ ## **10. Post-MVP Feature: Multi-Canvas Workspace Management**
+ 
+ **Status:** Planned for Phase 3  
+ **Priority:** High  
+ **Goal:** Allow users to create, manage, and share multiple separate canvas workspaces with granular permissions.
+ 
+ ### **Feature Overview**
+ 
+ Users can create multiple independent canvases (workspaces/rooms), each with its own collaborative space, object state, and user permissions. This transforms the application from a single shared canvas to a comprehensive workspace management system where users can organize different projects and control access.
+ 
+ ### **Required Capabilities**
+ 
+ - **Canvas Creation & Management:** Users can create new canvases, name them, and organize projects
+ - **Sharing & Permissions:** Canvas owners can invite collaborators with different access levels (owner, editor, viewer)
+ - **Canvas Discovery:** Users can browse their own canvases and canvases shared with them
+ - **Real-time Navigation:** Switch between canvases without losing connection or disrupting other users
+ - **Canvas Metadata:** Rich information including creation date, last modified, collaborator count, preview thumbnails
+ 
+ ### **User Stories**
+ 
+ | As a... | I want to... | So that... |
+ | :--- | :--- | :--- |
+ | **Project Manager** | create separate canvases for different projects | I can organize work and avoid mixing content between projects |
+ | **Canvas Owner** | invite specific collaborators to my canvas | I can control who has access to sensitive or private work |
+ | **Collaborator** | see all canvases I have access to in a dashboard | I can easily navigate between different projects |
+ | **Team Lead** | set different permission levels for team members | I can give appropriate access (view-only vs. editing) based on roles |
+ | **Designer** | create a private canvas for sketching | I can work on ideas privately before sharing with the team |
+ | **User** | see live previews/thumbnails of my canvases | I can quickly identify and switch to the right canvas |
+ 
+ ### **Technical Requirements**
+ 
+ - **Canvas Data Model:** Each canvas is an independent entity with unique ID, metadata, and isolated object state
+ - **Permission System:** Role-based access control (Owner, Editor, Viewer) with granular permissions
+ - **Sharing Mechanisms:** Invite by email, shareable links, and public canvas options
+ - **Canvas Dashboard:** Responsive interface showing user's canvases with sorting, filtering, and search
+ - **Real-time Updates:** Canvas list updates in real-time when new canvases are shared or permissions change
+ - **Performance:** Canvas switching should be near-instantaneous (<500ms) with proper state management
```

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I need to add the detailed PR specification to the task.md file. This will be a comprehensive PR that includes all the technical implementation details, file changes, subtasks, and testing strategy for the multi-canvas feature.

Looking at the existing task structure, I should add this as PR #12 (since PR #11 is the AI Canvas Agent). This will be a significant PR with many components.</details></think>

+ 
+ **Acceptance Criteria:**
+ 
+ | Test Scenario | Expected Outcome |
+ | :--- | :--- |
+ | **Create new canvas** | User can create canvas with name/description, becomes owner with full permissions |
+ | **Share canvas with collaborator** | Owner can invite users via email with specific roles (Editor/Viewer) |
+ | **Switch between canvases** | Canvas switching completes in <500ms with proper state isolation |
+ | **Permission enforcement** | Users can only perform actions allowed by their role (Owner/Editor/Viewer) |
+ | **Real-time collaboration per canvas** | Multiple users can collaborate on different canvases simultaneously |
+ | **Dashboard functionality** | Users see all accessible canvases with search, filter, and sort capabilities |
+ | **Canvas state persistence** | Each canvas maintains independent object state and user presence |
+ | **Shareable links** | Canvas owners can generate public links with configurable permissions |
+ 
+ **Success Metrics:**
+ - **Canvas Creation:** <2s to create new canvas with proper permissions setup
+ - **Canvas Switching:** <500ms to switch between canvases without connection drops
+ - **Permission Updates:** Real-time permission changes propagate in <100ms
+ - **Dashboard Performance:** Load 100+ canvases with smooth scrolling and search
+ - **Collaboration Isolation:** Perfect state separation between simultaneous canvas sessions
+ 
+ **Technical Dependencies:**
+ - ✅ WebSocket real-time synchronization (MVP complete)
+ - ✅ User authentication system (MVP complete)  
+ - ✅ Canvas object management (MVP complete)
+ - ⏳ Enhanced database schema for multi-canvas support
+ - ⏳ Permission-based API middleware
+ - ⏳ Canvas-specific WebSocket namespacing
+ 
+ **Risk Mitigation:**
+ - **Performance Degradation:** Implement canvas state caching and lazy loading
+ - **Permission Complexity:** Start with simple roles, expand gradually
+ - **Real-time State Management:** Leverage existing conflict resolution for canvas-level operations
+ - **Database Migration:** Implement backward compatibility during schema transition
+ - **User Experience:** Provide clear navigation and canvas organization tools

6. **State Isolation**: Perfect separation between simultaneous canvas collaborations

## Technical Architecture:

- **Backend**: Canvas-specific WebSocket namespaces, permission middleware, enhanced database schema
- **Frontend**: Dashboard components, sharing modals, navigation system, canvas routing
- **Performance**: Canvas thumbnail caching, lazy loading, <500ms switching target
- **Security**: Role-based API validation, audit logging, permission inheritance

The specification transforms your single canvas application into a comprehensive workspace management system while maintaining all existing collaborative features. Each canvas becomes an independent project space with its own user permissions and real-time collaboration.

Great. Now work on 1.1 Canvas Data Models

_**Assistant (claude-4-sonnet-thinking)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to work on the first subtask in PR #12, which is "1.1 Canvas Data Models". Looking at the task.md file, this includes:

**1.1 Canvas Data Models**
- [ ] Create Canvas model with metadata (id, name, description, owner, created/modified dates)
- [ ] Implement CanvasPermission model for role-based access control
- [ ] Add canvas thumbnail generation and storage system
- [ ] Create canvas state isolation in database (Firestore collections per canvas)
- [ ] Implement canvas deletion with cleanup of associated data

I should:
1. First explore the current codebase to understand the existing data models and structure
2. Look at the shared types and backend models
3. Create the new Canvas and CanvasPermission models
4. Update shared types accordingly
5. Set up the foundation for canvas thumbnail generation

Let me start by exploring the current structure to understand what exists.</details></think>

I'll start working on the Canvas Data Models for the multi-canvas feature. Let me first explore the current codebase structure to understand the existing data models and then implement the new Canvas and CanvasPermission models.
