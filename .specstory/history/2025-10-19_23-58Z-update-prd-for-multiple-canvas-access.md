# Update PRD for multiple canvas access (2025-10-19 23:58Z)

_**User (2025-10-19 16:06Z)**_

Read the following files for context: @PRD.md , @task.md , @architecture.mermaid .

Currently there is only one canvas that all users can access. I would like to implement access for a user to create, share, and access multiple different canvases.

Update the PRD file with a new PR that specifies all the requirements to implement this feature.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to add multi-canvas support to their collaborative canvas application. This is a significant feature that will require updates to both frontend and backend, as well as the database schema to support multiple canvases per user with sharing capabilities.

Let me analyze what I need to add:

1. Canvas/Room management - users should be able to create new canvases/rooms
2. Canvas sharing - users should be able to share canvases with specific users or make them public
3. Canvas listing/dashboard - users need a way to see all their canvases and shared canvases
4. Navigation between canvases
5. Permission system for different access levels (owner, editor, viewer)
6. Canvas metadata (name, description, creation date, last modified, etc.)

This will require significant backend changes:
- New data models for Canvas/Room entities
- Canvas management endpoints
- Permission/sharing system
- Updated authentication to include canvas-</details></think>
